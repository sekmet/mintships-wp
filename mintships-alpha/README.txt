üöÄ Mintships makes sharing unlockable content using NFTs(erc1155 and erc721) and Tokens(erc20) possible and easy for all creators and recognizes tokens held in the wallet upon scanning of a QR code to enable the use of membership/ticket NFTs in physical spaces.‚ö°Ô∏è

Because every creator should have an easy, direct way to share premium content with their community.

There are many NFT token gating solutions available today, but none of them handle content distribution well. As a creator who wants to give exclusive access to media based, NFT token gating falls short. What creators need is a way to store private, verifiable content AND being able to serve that content based on ownership of an NFT.

Mintships tries solves that. A simpler way to lock exclusive media content behind ownership of an NFT.

Upload a file, add some data about the file, choose what NFT contract (contract address and EVM chain) to check on, and thats it.

Creator will get a unique link that they can share knowing that the exlusive content is safely protected from unauthorized access. NFT projects, individual artists, brands, and more can leverage Mintships to easily lock and serve content.
